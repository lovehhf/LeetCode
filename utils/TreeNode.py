A leetcode TreeNode helper.
1. How to use it:
    Just like the leetcode way.

2. How it helps:
    a. You can easily create a tree of nodes and return the root by 
        inputing a list, like the problems in Leetcode:
            lst = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
            root = List2TN(lst)

        Specific nodes in the list can be returned if needed:
            lst = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

        Not only the root node, we also want the instances of the 5th one and 
        the 7th one:
            root, nodesInTree = List2TN(lst, [4, 6])
            (nodesInTree: [[Self: 4]/L: 9/R: 10, [Self: 6]/L: None/R: None])

    b. Change the way of representation from the default one. When you 
        print out a Treenode, the values of itself and the left node and 
        right node would be shown. This also works when you are debugging. 
        The IDE would present a TreeNode like:
            [Self: 7]/L: 82/R: 82

    c. You can change a tree by handling the root to a list by calling the 
        function:
            lst = TN2List(root)
3. Just run this file and try it out!
